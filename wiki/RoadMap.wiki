#summary Plans and ideas

Design goals:
  * Be standalone and not too heavy, so the library can easily be incorporated into other projects. Things like themeing and such are probably too platform-specific to implement.
  * Be focused: do forms well, but don't do other stuff.

We're at version 0.1 now, to get to 1.0 we need a stable version.

Features:
  * Validation: automatically generate client side validation. Also do server side validation for common stuff (email, required, ...). Also allow user to define a validation function that is called.
  * Ajax. Deal with ajax somehow.
